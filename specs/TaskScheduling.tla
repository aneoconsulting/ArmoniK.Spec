(*   - Tasks have input/output data abstracted by objects.             *)
(*   - Tasks can depend on each other via their input/output data.     *)
(*   - Agents (workers) execute tasks.                                      *)

CONSTANTS
    AgentId,    \* Set of agent identifiers (theoretically infinite).
    ObjectId,   \* Set of object identifiers (theoretically infinite).
    TaskId      \* Set of task identifiers (theoretically infinite).

ASSUME Assumptions ==
    \* AgentId, TaskId and ObjectId are three disjoint sets
    /\ AgentId \intersect ObjectId = {}
    /\ AgentId \intersect TaskId = {}
    /\ ObjectId \intersect TaskId = {}

VARIABLES
    alloc,        \* alloc[a] is the set of tasks currently scheduled on agent a.
    taskStatus,   \* taskStatus[t] is the execution status of task t.
    targets,
    objectStatus, \* objectStatus[o] is the status of object o.
    deps          \* dependencies between tasks and objects as a directed graph
                  \* whose nodes deps.node are task or object identifiers, and
                  \* whose edges deps.edge represent the data dependencies between
                  \* tasks.

    \* Each task has one of the five possible status.

    \* Dependencies between tasks and objects form a graph whose nodes are
    \* labeled by task and object IDs.

(**
 * Helper to check if a graph is ArmoniK-compliant for the given sets of task
 * and object IDs. A valid graph must satisfy the following constraints:
 *   - it is directed and acyclic.
 *   - It is bipartite with TaskId and ObjectId subsets as partitions.
 *   - All its roots are objects (are labeled by elements of ObjectId).
 *   - All its leaves are objects (are labeled by elements of ObjectId).
 *   - No node is isolated (this condition could be removed for object nodes,
       but related cases are not of great interest).
 *   - Every object node has at most one predecessor, that is, an object can be
 *     written at most by one task
 *
 * Note: Note: There is no requirement for the graph to be connected.

 * Returns the set of outputs of task t in graph G that are delegated.
 * An output o of t is considered delegated if there exists some predecessor u of t
 * such that u â‰  t and t is an ancestor of o in the task/IO dependency graph.

 * dynamically spawned (child) tasks rather than by t itself.
